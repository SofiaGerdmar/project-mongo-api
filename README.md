# Project Mongo API

An API with Pokemon data built using Mongoose and MongoDB.

## The problem

I started out with adding a couple of basic endpoints, and progressed into a few queries. I wanted to try out fetching string, numbers and boolean values, so I chose endpoints that enabled me to do that. After connecting my Compass to Atlas I deployed it on Render.
